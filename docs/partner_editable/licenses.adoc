// Include details about the license and how they can sign up. If no license is required, clarify that. 

All AWS service resources consumed during the launch of the Quick Start incur AWS service usage costs. 

If you deploy this Quick Start with Element Unify, you need a license. AWS Partners or customers who do not have a license to use Element Unify can get a free trial through the https://aws.amazon.com/marketplace/pp/prodview-trvx6gn4vqeok[AWS Marketplace^].

Some configurations of the {partner-product-short-name} Quick Start involve the use of a partner edge application. You are responsible for obtaining a license directly from the software vendor. Applications that integrate with the {partner-product-short-name} Quick Start are available from the following vendors:

* Inductive Automation, vendor for Ignition.
* Cirrus Link, vendor for the MQTT transmission module for the Ignition software stack.
* PTC, vendor for KEPServerEX.
* Element Analytics, Inc., vendor for Element Unify.

//TODO Shivansh, Element Unify is not a partner edge application, so it doesn't belong in this list. I think we can just delete that fourth bullet point and let the second paragraph say what we need to say. Agree?
