// There are generally two deployment options. If additional are required, add them here

This Quick Start provides four deployment options - 2 for Asset model converter(AMC) drivers and 2 for Element Unify. The Asset model converter converts tag definitions and source data models from edge devices into AWS IoT SiteWise models. Whereas,  Element Unify uses a no code/low code approach to build and publish models to AWS IoT SiteWise.
