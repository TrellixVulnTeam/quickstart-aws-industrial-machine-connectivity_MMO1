// There are generally two deployment options. If additional are required, add them here

This Quick Start provides four deployment options: two for AMC and two for Element Unify. 

* *Deploy {partner-product-name} with AMC drivers into a new VPC*. This option builds a new AWS environment consisting of the VPC, subnet, security group, and other infrastructure components. It then deploys {partner-product-name} with AMC drivers into this new VPC.
* *Deploy {partner-product-name} with AMC drivers into an existing VPC*. This option provisions {partner-product-name} with AMC drivers in the default VPC of your existing AWS infrastructure.
* *Deploy {partner-product-name} with Element Unify into a new VPC*. This option builds a new AWS environment consisting of the VPC, subnet, security group, and other infrastructure components. It then deploys {partner-product-name} with Element Unify into this new VPC.
* *Deploy {partner-product-name} with Element Unify into an existing VPC*. This option provisions {partner-product-name} with Element Unify in the default VPC of your existing AWS infrastructure.

The Quick Start provides separate templates for these options.
